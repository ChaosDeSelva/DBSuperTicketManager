* Implement the New Ticket component (the component already exists)
  * create `action.js` and `mutation.js` methods to mutate the state
* Add functionality that enables the user to change a ticket's status
* Add a counter next to the lane title that indicates the number of tickets
* Fix any linting errors
* Add a new page, route, and nav item. (lorem ipsum is fine)

### Bonus
* Refactor areas lacking in best practices and accessibility
* Add some kind of indicator that clicking a ticket title allows you to edit
* Add some tests
